The objective for this particular project was to utilize the Twitter API and the Google NLP API together in order to demonstrate our ability to utilize both APIs and our ability to write modular Code. My project was initially supposed to be able to compare the sentiments and contents of tweets from two different twitter accounts, or groups of twitter accounts. Unfortunately, I was unable to achieve this due to running into constant errors with the google NLP api that had difficulties handling the format of some tweets. In order to satisfy the requirements of this assignment, I have writtent a new script that still utilizes both the Twitter and the Google NLP APIs to grab tweets and analyze their overall sentiment score and the subject matter of the tweets. The user enters a keyword they would like searched, the date on which they would like the keyword to be searched, and the number of tweets with that keyword they would like analyzed. This returns and overal sentiment score, either positive or negative, and gives the general category in which that keyword was used. This gives the user the ability to analyze a large nubmer of tweets in a short period of time and gives a picture of the context in which the word was used. I will include some screentshots of the results below.
