This project will utilize the Twitter and Google NLP APIs in order to grab tweets and anlyze their content. This program will be capable of taking several recent tweets from two people or groups of people and determine the sentiment of the tweets and the topic category the tweet covers. The hope is that this project will be utilized by users quickly determine differences in tweets written by individuals or certain groups of people. 

In the case of this specific project, I will be taking the top 5 twitter accounts (determined by follower count) of elected members from the Republican and Democratic political parties. I will then be taking the top 100 tweets from each of the selected people. Engagement will be defined as a total of the likes, comments, and retweets on a given tweet. The aggregated 500 top tweets representing the Democratic and Republican parties will be retrieved and aggregated utilizing the twitter API and the text within the tweets will be analyzed using the google NLP APIs. The top 3 categories covered by the tweets for each party will be determined, and an overall sentiment score will be determined for each party. While this will not necessarily provide a fully accurate picutre of everything either party discusses on twitter and how positive or negative they are in general, it may still provide an interesting data point.

The above example is only one potential use case for this program, but comparing sentiment and subject between two people or groups of people easily may be interesting for different reasons. For example- social media is often credited with the worsening of users' mental health. By taking two different media outlets and aggregating several hundreds of their tweets and retreiving a sentiment score, perhaps a user could select the media outlet with the seemingly more positive sentiment score in hopes of viewing fewer negative headlines, and therefore potentially helping improve their own wellbeing. 

I will aim to make the code as easy to use as possible, especially in regards to the changing of the parameters so that nearly anyone with a computer and access to the internet will be able to read through the directions and then utilize the script to compare sentiment and subject matter between any two twitter accounts or two groups of accounts.
